            <p> <i> Would like to provide a brief overview of my background. I hold a <b>  Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science </b> from the <mark>  College of Computer Studies at Tarlac State University </mark>. Although I graduated with Latin honors, I experienced a sense of disappointment regarding my first formal employment, which was not aligned with my field of study. My initial position was as a non-voice customer service representative. However, I have come to understand that working in this role is not without its challenges. While it may not be physically demanding, it can be mentally exhausting and may lead to burnout.</i> </p>

            <dt>  <h4>My ambitions is:</h4> </dt>
            <dd>  <p> As a passionate and persevering Computer Science graduate, I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity to understand how technology shapes the world. I knew that to really immerse myself in the field and sharpen my skills, I needed more than just academic knowledge I needed to gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting. That’s why I set my sights on a position in a company where I could not only contribute my knowledge but also learn from industry professionals, see the daily operations of a tech-driven business, and grow my professional network.
                <br>The journey wasn’t without its challenges, though. I realized that to truly succeed in my chosen path, whether as a Web Developer, Software Engineer, or even a Data Analyst, I needed a solid foundation. I made it a priority to build a personalized roadmap that would help me strengthen my fundamentals. With each step, I focused on mastering key skills, diving into the latest technologies, and ensuring that I was always pushing the boundaries of what I knew.
                <br>Along the way, I discovered that the more I learned, the more I wanted to contribute to the evolving landscape of technology. My goal isn’t just to enhance my career prospects it’s to be part of something bigger, to contribute to the success of a company while continuing to grow and evolve in the process. And now, as I look toward the future, I’m excited for the opportunity to bring my skills and ambition to a team that values growth, innovation, and collaboration.

            <h4><i>My Realization upon applying to different company</i></h4>
            <p><i>  One of my key realizations during my applications to various tech companies has been the importance of truly understanding what’s expected of me. After reflecting on the process, I’ve come to recognize the following reasons behind this understanding:</i></p>
             <ul>
                <li> First, I've realized that knowing someone within the company whether through a personal connection or having a "backer" can significantly impact the hiring process. Even though an applicant might take credit for things they haven’t done, it seems that connections can sometimes open doors that skill alone can’t. This often leads to situations where individuals who may not be fully qualified get hired, and the lines between truth and embellishment blur. It’s a curious and sometimes frustrating aspect of the industry. <sup>kewkk</sup></li>
             </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>
                    Second, I’ve come to realize that just because we study IT-related fields, it doesn’t necessarily mean that every piece of knowledge will be directly applied in the workplace. The true value of university lies not only in the technical skills we acquire but also in the deeper lessons about professional ethics and behavior. University helps to shape our understanding of the kind of integrity and work culture we should uphold when we eventually step into the company environment.
                </li>
             </ul>
             <ul>
                <li>Third, one of my later realizations was that even while we’re still in university as freshmen, having a GitHub account is crucial. It’s not just about showcasing your progress, but it’s also become one of the key criteria that employers look at to assess your skills and capabilities. So, while you’re still studying, it’s important to start building a portfolio. Take on different projects that allow you to flex your skills and demonstrate what you can really do. It’s an investment in your future, one that can make a huge difference when you start applying for jobs.</li>
