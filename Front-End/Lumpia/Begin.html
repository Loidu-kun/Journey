                <p> I’m a recent graduate, I’ve developed a solid foundation in web development through my coursework and personal projects. I’ve gained experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve used these skills to build websites and interactive elements. While I may not have professional experience yet, I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned in a real-world environment. I’m a quick learner, and I’m excited about the opportunity to further develop my skills, collaborate with your team, and contribute to your projects."</p>
